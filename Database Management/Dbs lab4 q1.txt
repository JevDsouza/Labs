1)Create the above tables by properly specifying the primary keys and the foreign
keys.

create table Person (
driver_id# varchar(30),
name varchar(50), 
Address varchar(100),
primary key (driver_id#));

create table car (
regno varchar(20), 
model varchar(30), 
Year int,
primary key (regno));

create table accident(
report_number int, 
accd_date date, 
location varchar(50),
primary key (report_number));

create table OWNS (
driver_id# varchar(30) references person, 
regno varchar(20) references car,
primary key (driver_id#, regno));

create table PARTICIPATED (
driver_id# varchar(30) references person,
regno varchar(20) references car,
report_number int references accident, 
damage_amount int,
primary key (driver_id#, regno, report_number));


1. 
select count(participated.regno) as t
from participated, accident
where participated.report_number=accident.report_number;

2.
select count(participated.regno) as count
from participated, car
where participated.regno=car.regno and car.model= 'TATA';

3.
 
select person.name as n, count(participated.report_number) as no, sum(damage_amount) as t
from person, participated
where person.driver_id#= participated.driver_id#
group by person.name, participated.driver_id#
order by 1/t desc;

4.
select owns.driver_id#
from owns, participated
where owns.driver_id#= participated.driver_id#
group by owns.driver_id#
having count(participated.driver_id#)>1;

5.
select driver_id# from person
minus 
select driver_id# from participated;

add

CUSTOMER (cust#: int, cname: varchar(50), city: varchar(30))
ORDERS (order#:int, odate: date, cust#: int, ordamt: int)
ITEM (item#: int, unitprice: int)
ORDER_ITEMS (order#:int, item#:int, qty:int,)
SHIPMENT (order#: int, warehouse#: int, shipdate: date)
WAREHOUSE (warehouse#:int, city: varchar(30))


1.
select cname
from customer, orders
where odate='9-may-2015';

2.
select count(item#), order#
from order_items
group by order#;

3
select order#, max(iqty)
from order_items
group by order#;

4.

select shipdate, count(order#) from shipment natural join order_items
group by shipdate
having count(*) >=1
order by count(*) desc; 

5. 
delete from order_items where item = 11;
